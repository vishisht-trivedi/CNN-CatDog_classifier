# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier 🐱🐶

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras. It is trained to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a dataset from Kaggle. The code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook: `CatDogCNN.ipynb`.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Trained on the standard Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle
- Validation and accuracy tracking

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Usage

Get dataset from [Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and setup according to path set. Run the file to train the model.

## 📊 Output

The notebook includes visualizations for:

- Model accuracy & loss over epochs
- Example predictions
- Image preprocessing pipeline

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the model using custom images after training. Just ensure the image size is 128x128 or it will be resized before prediction.
